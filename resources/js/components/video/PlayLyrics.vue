                I've always been the one to say the first goodbye<br/>
                Had to love and lose a hundred million times<br/>
                Had to get it wrong to know just what I like<br/>
                Now I'm fallin'<br/>

                You say my name like I have never heard before<br/>
                I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure<br/>
                I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all<br/>

                Center of attention<br/>
                You know you can get whatever you want from me<br/>
                Whenever you want it, baby<br/>
                It's you in my reflection<br/>
                Now I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me<br/>
                If I would've known it, baby<br/>

                I would've stayed at home<br/>
                'Cause I was doin' better alone<br/>
                But when you said, "Hello"<br/>
                I know that was the end of it all<br/>
                I should've stayed at home<br/>
                'Cause now there ain't no letting you go<br/>
                Am I falling in love<br/>
                With the one that could break my heart?<br/>
                Oh no, I was doin' better alone<br/>

                I wonder when you go, if I stay on your mind
                Two can play that game, but you win me every time
                Everyone before you was a waste of time
                Yeah, you got me
